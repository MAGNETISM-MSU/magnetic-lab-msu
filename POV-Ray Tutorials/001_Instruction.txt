Getting started (for Linux)

1. Create text file named filename.pov in the repository file on your local
2. Put some command lines to generate an object
   Remember that POV-Ray is based on left-handed coordinating system
            +y axis is pointing up
            +x axis is pointing to the right
            +z axis is pointing into the screen
   However, we can rotate the coordinate by using the command line 'sky'. 
   For example, 
       
   2.1 Included POV-Ray packages (or not is fine, it depends on your designs)
       For example
            #include "colors.inc"  for calling the standard color appeared on software
            #include "metals.inc"  for calling the metals texture applied to objects
            
   2.2 Define the position of camera
   
            camera {
                        location <20,0,0>
                        look_at <0,0,0>
                        angle 90
                   }
                   
       However, we can rotate the coordinate by using the command line 'sky' in the camera. 
       For example, +z axis is set to point up.
       
            camera {
                        sky <0,0,1>
                        location <15,10,17>
                        look_at <1,13,5>
                        angle 90
                   }
                   
   2.3 Add light source into the scene
   
   
   2.4 Set background color
   
   
   
   2.5 Insert objects
   
   
   2.6 Put some texture effects on objects
   
   
   
3. Render filename.pov to produce an image as one of each following command line
   3.1 povray filename.pov                    >> producing regular image with standard pixel (+a1.0)
   3.2 povray filename.pov +a0.1              >> producing high resolution image with large pixel
   3.3 povray filename.pov +H440 +W560        >> producing regular image with specified size of image
   3.4 povray filename.pov +a0.1 +H440 +W560  >> producing high resolution image with large pixel and specified size of image
4. The .png file will be produced in the same repository file with the same filename
