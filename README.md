This branch of git has been made up to share our graphical templates for using on gnuplot (more info: www.gnuplot.info/).
Additionally, the fundamental tutorials of the POV-Ray visualization software package (more info: www.povray.org) is also presented.




### WHAT IS GNUPLOT?

Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed. It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986.

### WHAT IS POV-RAY?

POV-Ray is a visualization software package which is used for producing the high qualitative images with realistic reflection. The more sophisticated textures can be also produced with the specific commands. Moreover, it is able to use in many platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and etc. The visualization is also very useful for the description of some complex phenomema in Physics. Therefore, we make this tutorial to learn and share knowledges about using PoV-Ray. The following images are some examples.

The above picture represents the evolution of magnetic recording technologies in hard diske drive (HDD) from the beginning until now which are longitudinal magnetic recording (LMR), perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR), heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), and microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR), respectively.


![structure](https://github.com/MAGNETISM-MSU/magnetic-lab-msu/blob/master/Image%20library/structure_crop.png)

This picture shows the atomic unit cell structures of materials which are simple cubic (SC), body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC), and hexagonal close packed (HCP) from left to right.



![EB](https://github.com/MAGNETISM-MSU/magnetic-lab-msu/blob/master/Image%20library/EB_crop.png)

The visualization is also very useful for the description of some complex phenomema in Physics. For example, the following image refers to the magnetization revesal process in the magnetic bilayer system at any time and external magnetic field called hysteresis loop. In order to explain the state of magnetization in each time step, we need some visualizations to ease that. Therefore, the realistic images must be produced.

#### HOW TO START?
1. Go to download links for [Windows](http://www.povray.org/download/) and [Linux](http://www.povray.org/download/linux.php)
2. Get some instructions from the [POV-Ray](https://github.com/MAGNETISM-MSU/magnetic-lab-msu/blob/master/POV-Ray%20Tutorials/000_About%20POV-Ray.pdf) and the [tutorials](https://github.com/MAGNETISM-MSU/magnetic-lab-msu/blob/master/POV-Ray%20Tutorials/001_Instruction.txt) (more info: www.povray.org)
3. Download xxx_filename.pov from [here](https://github.com/MAGNETISM-MSU/magnetic-lab-msu/tree/master/POV-Ray%20Tutorials) to place in the reposity folder on your local
4. Generate an image following the basic command lines from the tutorials
5. Try on others :)

##### HINT: The tutorials here has been made up for using on Linux only !
