This branch of git has been made up to share our graphical templates for using on gnuplot (more info: www.gnuplot.info/).
Additionally, the fundamental tutorials of the POV-Ray visualization software package (more info: www.povray.org) is also presented.




WHAT IS GNUPLOT?





WHAT IS POV-RAY?

POV-Ray is a visualization software package which is used for producing the high qualitative images with realistic reflection. The more sophisticated textures can be also produced with the specific commands. Moreover, it is able to use in many platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and etc. The visualization is also very useful for the description of some complex phenomema in Physics. Therefore, we make this tutorial to learn and share knowledges about using PoV-Ray. The following images are some examples.

The evolution of magnetic recording technologies in hard diske drive (HDD) from the beginning until now which are longitudinal magnetic recording (LMR), perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR), heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), and microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR), respectively.

HOW TO START?

1. Go to POV-Ray tutorials folder
2. Get some basic command lines for producing an image in the [tutorials](https://github.com/MAGNETISM-MSU/magnetic-lab-msu/blob/master/POV-Ray%20Tutorials/000_About%20POV-Ray.pdf) (more info: www.povray.org)
3. Download xxx_filename.pov to place in the reposity folder on your browser
4. Try to generate an image with the basic command lines from the tutorials
5. Try on others :)
